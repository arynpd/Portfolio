        <br><br>
        <p> I was born in Nepal and moved to the United States in 2007.</p>
        <p> I decided to pursue Computer Science from when I was in highschool when I starting learning programming.</p>
        <P> Currently I'm getting my <em> Bachelors of Science </em> in Computer Science with an expected graduation date of 2025.</p>

        <br>

                <li> I moved back to Nepal in 2015 and stayed until 2019.</li>
                <li> I first got interested in programming when I was in 5th grade when I found out how to change display content on webpages by accessing the console.</li>
